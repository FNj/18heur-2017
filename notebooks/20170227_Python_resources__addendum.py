# # Resources for learning Python, numpy, pandas and Jupyter notebooks (addendum)

# **Read this guide/tutorial first**: [Running Jupyter Notebooks With The Anaconda Python Distribution](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/tutorial-jupyter-notebook).
# 
# Notes:
# * You can skip parts on pip & docker. 
# * Install Anaconda (with Python 3) only.
# * Do not hesitate to follow links included in the guide.

# ### Other resources:
# 
# * [Intro to Python for Data Science](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/intro-to-python-for-data-science) - I do not have personal experience with this course, but since it was referenced in the DataCamp guide, it should be OK (and free)
# * [Python Data Science Cookbook](https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/python-data-science-cookbook) - book I can highly recommend
# * [Python for Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/python-for-data-science-and-machine-learning-bootcamp/) - Udemy course, great course with videos and examples in Jupyter notebooks (often in sale for ca. $10, but not now, unfortunately)
# * Last, but not least, **Google**. Feel free to type name of module you are interested in and you will find lots of helpful resources. Official documentation sites (e.g. for [NumPy](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.12.0/reference/)) are great places to start as well.

# ### Good luck!
